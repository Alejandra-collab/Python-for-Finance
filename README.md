# Python-for-Finance

### get-data.py
In this script you are going to be able to look the code to download data from Yahoo Finance.

### web-scraping.py
In this script I expose how to use Python to request information from a web page in an automated way.

### JarqueBera-test
The Jarque-Bera test is a goodness of fit test (which describes how well a set of observations fit).

If the data comes from a normal distribution, the JB test will behave like a chi-square distribution with two degrees of freedom.

The null hypothesis is that our distribution is normal (skewness = 0, excess kurtosis = 0). With a JB > 6 the distribution is not normal.
